# Databricks notebook source
# MAGIC %md # Training machine learning models on tabular data: an end-to-end example (non-Unity Catalog)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This tutorial covers the following steps:
# MAGIC - Visualize the data using Seaborn and matplotlib
# MAGIC - Run a parallel hyperparameter sweep to train multiple models
# MAGIC - Explore hyperparameter sweep results with MLflow
# MAGIC - Register the best performing model in MLflow
# MAGIC - Apply the registered model to another dataset using a Spark UDF
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this example, you build a model to predict the quality of Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine based on the wine's physicochemical properties. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The example uses a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, presented in [*Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923609001377?via%3Dihub) [Cortez et al., 2009].
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Requirements

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Merge the two DataFrames into a single dataset, with a new binary feature "is_red" that indicates whether the wine is red or white.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Plot a histogram of the dependent variable, quality.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Looks like quality scores are normally distributed between 3 and 9. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Define a wine as high quality if it has quality >= 7.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Box plots are useful for identifying correlations between features and a binary label. Create box plots for each feature to compare high-quality and low-quality wines. Significant differences in the box plots indicate good predictors of quality.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md In the above box plots, a few variables stand out as good univariate predictors of quality. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - In the alcohol box plot, the median alcohol content of high quality wines is greater than even the 75th quantile of low quality wines. High alcohol content is correlated with quality.
# MAGIC - In the density box plot, low quality wines have a greater density than high quality wines. Density is inversely correlated with quality.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ## Preprocess data
# MAGIC Before training a model, check for missing values and split the data into training and validation sets.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ## Prepare the dataset to train a baseline model
# MAGIC Split the input data into 3 sets:
# MAGIC - Train (60% of the dataset used to train the model)
# MAGIC - Validation (20% of the dataset used to tune the hyperparameters)
# MAGIC - Test (20% of the dataset used to report the true performance of the model on an unseen dataset)

# COMMAND ----------



# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ## Train a baseline model
# MAGIC This task seems well suited to a random forest classifier, since the output is binary and there may be interactions between multiple variables.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Build a simple classifier using scikit-learn and use MLflow to keep track of the model's accuracy, and to save the model for later use.

# COMMAND ----------



# COMMAND ----------



# COMMAND ----------



# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Review the learned feature importances output by the model. As illustrated by the previous boxplots, alcohol and density are important in predicting quality.

# COMMAND ----------



# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md You logged the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) to MLflow. Click the Experiment icon <img src="https://docs.databricks.com/_static/images/icons/experiment.png"/> in the right sidebar to display the Experiment Runs sidebar. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The model achieved an AUC of 0.854.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC A random classifier would have an AUC of 0.5, and higher AUC values are better. For more information, see [Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic#Area_under_the_curve).
